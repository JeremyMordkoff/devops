README for the OSM devops repository

24 June 2016 -- Jeremy Mordkoff -- Genesis
--------------------------------------


This is the OSM devops repository

OSM members can find more information at https://osm.etsi.org/wiki/index.php/DEVOPS_TF

The basic workflow is
-- create any needed images in your container server
-- run ./jenkins/host/start_build MDG
   where MDG is the name of an MDG

This system currently supports lxc containers.
